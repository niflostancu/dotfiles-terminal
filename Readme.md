# Personal Shell Config

This repository publishes my personal zsh / bash configs.

The Zsh config is based on the [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) plugin
manager, with a couple of tweaks to make it further lightweight.

Prerequisites:

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), ofc;
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): fuzzy finder (e.g., used for Ctrl+R
  history search);
- [git](https://git-scm.com/), for automatic plugin downloading;

TODO: proper documentation (features, key bindings, customization etc.).

# Installation

First, take a look on the [`install.sh`](./install.sh) script.

If it's okay, run it ;) 
Otherwise, just take the fragments you like and start customizing it!

# Customization

You can customize anything by creating _*.custom.[z]sh_ files near the stock
ones. Please check the source code for details, for now.
